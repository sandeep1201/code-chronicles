# Portfolio Construction

## Description

Designs a diversified stock portfolio based on risk profile with sector
allocation, position sizing, and rebalancing strategy.

## Prompt

Design a diversified stock portfolio based on my risk profile:
[LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH].

Include:

- Allocation across sectors with rationale
- Individual positions with sizing (% of portfolio)
- Explanation for why each position exists in the portfolio
- Correlation analysis (how positions relate to each other)
- Rebalancing frequency and triggers
- Portfolio-level risk metrics (max drawdown tolerance, volatility targets)
- How the portfolio aligns with stated risk profile

## Usage

Replace [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH] with your actual risk tolerance. Use this skill when
building a new portfolio or reviewing your existing portfolio allocation.
