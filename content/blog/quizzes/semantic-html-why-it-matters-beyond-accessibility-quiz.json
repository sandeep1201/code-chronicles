        }
      ],
      "explanation": "Semantic HTML uses elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to convey meaning about what the content is, not just how it looks. This helps browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies understand the structure and purpose of content."
    },

      "explanation": "There should be only one `<main>` element per page. It represents the main content of the page and should contain the primary content, not headers, footers, or sidebars. Multiple `<main>` elements would confuse assistive technologies and search engines."

        }
      ],
      "explanation": "Semantic HTML provides better SEO, improved accessibility, more maintainable code, and enables browser features like reader mode. However, it does NOT provide automatic styling—you still need CSS for appearance. Semantic HTML is about meaning, not appearance."

      "explanation": "True! Every `<section>` element should have a heading (`<h1>` through `<h6>`). Sections represent thematic groupings of content, and headings help create a proper document outline. If you can't think of a heading for a section, it might not need to be a section—use a `<div>` instead."

      ],
      "explanation": "Use `<div>` when you're grouping content for styling or layout purposes only, without any semantic meaning. For example, using `<div class=\"container\">` for layout is perfectly fine. Use semantic elements when the content has a specific meaning or purpose (header, navigation, main content, etc.)."

      "explanation": "Headings should be used in order (h1 → h2 → h3 → h4, etc.) without skipping levels. This creates a proper document outline that helps browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies understand the structure. There should typically be one `<h1>` per page, followed by `<h2>` for main sections, `<h3>` for subsections, and so on."
