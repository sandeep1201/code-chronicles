# Getting Started with MDX

MDX is a powerful format that lets you write **JSX** (React components) inside **Markdown** documents. It's the perfect tool for technical blogs, documentation, and interactive content.

## What is MDX?

MDX = **Markdown** + **JSX**

Think of it as Markdown on steroids. You get all the simplicity of Markdown for writing content, but you can also embed React components to add interactivity.

<Callout type="info">
**Why MDX?** It allows you to create rich, interactive documentation and blog posts without sacrificing the ease of writing in Markdown.
</Callout>

## Basic Markdown Syntax

All standard Markdown works in MDX:

### Headings

```markdown
# H1 Heading
## H2 Heading
### H3 Heading
```

### Text Formatting

You can use **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.

### Lists

Unordered lists:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Ordered lists:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}

greet("World")
```

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string
  age: number
}

const user: User = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
}
```

## The Power of Components

This is where MDX shines! You can embed React components directly in your content.

### Callouts

<Callout type="success">
This is a success callout! Perfect for highlighting positive outcomes or completed steps.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Warning callouts grab attention for important information that readers shouldn't miss.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
Error callouts help readers avoid common mistakes or pitfalls.
</Callout>

### Tables

MDX supports GitHub-flavored Markdown tables:

| Feature | Markdown | MDX |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Headings | ✅ | ✅ |
| Lists | ✅ | ✅ |
| Code blocks | ✅ | ✅ |
| React components | ❌ | ✅ |
| Interactivity | ❌ | ✅ |

## Writing Tips

### 1. Keep It Simple

Start with Markdown. Only add components when they truly enhance the content.

### 2. Use Callouts Strategically

<Callout type="info">
Callouts should highlight important information, not replace regular paragraphs.
</Callout>

### 3. Code Examples

Always include code examples for technical content:

```jsx
// Good: Clear, commented code
function Button({ text }) {
  return (
    <button className="btn">
      {text}
    </button>
  )
}
```

### 4. Break Up Content

Use headings, lists, and visual elements to make content scannable.

## Best Practices

1. **Write for humans first** - Clear, conversational prose
2. **Add interactivity** - Use components to enhance understanding
3. **Show, don't tell** - Include code examples and demos
4. **Stay organized** - Use consistent heading hierarchy
5. **Test your content** - Read it aloud, check all links

## Next Steps

Ready to start writing with MDX? Here's what to do:

- Create a new `.mdx` file in `content/blog/`
- Add frontmatter with title, excerpt, and tags
- Write your content using Markdown
- Add components where they add value
- Preview and publish!

<Callout type="success">
**Pro Tip**: Keep a "components library" document where you test different component combinations before using them in posts.
