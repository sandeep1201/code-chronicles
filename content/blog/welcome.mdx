# Welcome to Code Chronicles

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **Code Chronicles** - a place where I share my journey
through the ever-evolving world of software development.

## What is Code Chronicles?

Code Chronicles is more than just a blog. It's a **living documentation** of my
learning journey, a collection of tutorials, insights, and deep dives into
various programming topics. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced
developer, you'll find something valuable here.

<Callout type="info">
  **Learning in Public**: This blog follows the principle of "learning in
  public" - sharing knowledge as I learn, making mistakes, and growing together
  with the community.
</Callout>

  'Connect with other developers',
  'Practice technical writing',
];

reasons.forEach((reason) => {
  console.log(`✓ ${reason}`);
});
```

<Callout type="success">
  **Goal**: Help at least one person learn something new every day.
