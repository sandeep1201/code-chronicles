  "description": "Debouncing controls how often a function runs over time. When debounced with a wait of X ms, the callback runs only after X ms have passed since the debounced function was last called (e.g. elevator door: it closes only after you stop pressing 'Door open' for X duration). Implement debounce(callback, wait) that returns a function with debounced invocations.",
